# Project governance

This is a human-driven project. All changes are proposed, reviewed, and accepted by accountable human contributors. AI tools may assist humans in preparing changes, but contributions from AI agents acting autonomously will not be accepted.

# Contribution model

All changes produced with AI assistance MUST:

- Be submitted by a human contributor
- Follow the same documentation, contribution process, and coding standards as any human-authored change
- Meet all testing, review, and approval requirements
- Respect project architecture and constraints

AI assistance does not exempt a change from any project rule or expectation.

The human author of a change is fully responsible for its correctness, scope, and impact, regardless of how it was produced.

# Canonical documentation

Agents and humans alike must follow the canonical project documentation, which can be found as markdown (.md) files in the repo, particularly under /docs. This file does not define separate rules for AI systems; it clarifies that no such separate rules exist.

# Scope and autonomy limits

AI tools must not:

- Act without human initiation and review
- Expand the scope of a change beyond the human's intent
- Bypass project processes or safeguards
- Merge, deploy, or modify project state autonomously

All repository modifications occur through standard human-mediated workflows.

# Platform policy compliance

This project requires that all automated interactions with the repository comply with GitHub's terms of service and account policies.

- Human user accounts must not be operated by automated systems.
- Automation must use clearly identified machine or bot identities where permitted by the platform.
- Repository activity must accurately reflect accountable human authorship.

Contributions or interactions that appear to originate from automation operating through a human account, or otherwise violating GitHub policy, will be reported to GitHub.

This requirement exists to preserve accountability, attribution, and the integrity of the contribution process.
