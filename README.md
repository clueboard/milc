# MILC - An Opinionated Batteries-Included Python 3 CLI Framework

MILC is a framework for writing CLI applications in Python 3.6+. It gives you
all the features users expect from a modern CLI tool out of the box:

* CLI Argument Parsing, with or without subcommands
* Automatic tab-completion support through [argcomplete](https://github.com/kislyuk/argcomplete)
* Configuration file which can be overridden by CLI options
* ANSI color support- even on Windows- with [colorama](https://github.com/tartley/colorama)
* Logging to stderr and/or a file, with ANSI colors
* Easy method for printing to stdout with ANSI colors
* Labeling log output with colored emoji to easily distinguish message types
* Thread safety
* More than 60 built-in [spinners](https://github.com/manrajgrover/py-spinners) with the ability to add your own

# Breaking Changes

MILC follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). You can see a list of why we made major or minor releases on the [Breaking Changes](https://milc.clueboard.co/#/breaking_changes) page.

## Short Example

```python
from milc import MILC

cli = MILC('My useful CLI tool.')

@cli.argument('-c', '--comma', help='comma in output', default=True, action='store_boolean')
@cli.argument('-n', '--name', help='Name to greet', default='World')
@cli.entrypoint
def main(cli):
    comma = ',' if cli.config.general.comma else ''
    cli.log.info('Hello%s %s!', comma, cli.config.general.name)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    cli.run()
```

### Output

```
$ ./hello
ℹ Hello, World!
$ ./hello --no-unicode
INFO Hello, World!
$ ./hello --no-comma
ℹ Hello World!
$ ./hello -h
usage: hello [-h] [-V] [-v] [--datetime-fmt GENERAL_DATETIME_FMT]
             [--log-fmt GENERAL_LOG_FMT] [--log-file-fmt GENERAL_LOG_FILE_FMT]
             [--log-file GENERAL_LOG_FILE] [--color] [--no-color]
             [--config-file GENERAL_CONFIG_FILE] [--save-config]

# Why MILC?

Because life is too short to integrate this stuff yourself, and writing
good CLIs with comprehensive functionality is harder than it needs to be.

Most of the other CLI frameworks are missing a piece of the puzzle. Maybe
they have argument parsing but no config file story. Maybe they have a
good story around arguments and config but don't handle logging at all.
You know that you're doing the same integration work that almost everyone
else is doing in their own app. Why do we duplicate so much effort?

MILC is my answer to that. It implements a common set of CLI tools that
pretty much every project I have ever worked on either needed or would
have benefited from. Included in MILC are answers to problems you didn't
know you have:

* Config file saving and parsing
* Automatically overriding config options with CLI arguments
* Automatic verbose (-v) support
* Automatic log support
* Built-in flags for formatting log messages and log date formats
* Support for boolean arguments (define --foo and get --no-foo for free)
* Battle tested and used by hundreds of users every single day

You may not use all of these features yourself, but you will have users
who are very glad these options are available when they need them.

# FAQ

## What does MILC stand for?

MILC was originally the CLI Context Manager, or CLI Manager, but CLICM was too close to [click](https://click.palletsprojects.com/) and CLIM was already taken on PyPi. Reversing CLIM gave me a name I liked and had opportunities for puns, so I went with it.

## Why decorators instead of parsing function signatures?

Because I believe in writing good CLI tools.

Before writing MILC I saw variations of the same story over and over. "I
started with {Click,Docopt,Whatever} but after a while I ended up just
going back to argparse." In pretty much every case as the complexity of
their program grew they needed to do things argparse made easy and their
framework made hard.

MILC attempts to solve this by embracing the complexity of argparse. It
handles the drudgery of setting up argparse for you, but gives you an
elegant means to control that complexity when you need to. When your
CLI framework relies on parsing function signatures you are necessarily
limited in what you can do. Function annotations make this a little
better but they are not a full solution to the problem.

If you care about writing good CLI tools (and I hope you do) you will want
more control over the behavior of your program than Click or Docopt give you.

## Why Not Some Other CLI Framework Instead?

Whenever you release a new framework the first question you'll be asked is
why you didn't just use one of the existing options instead.

As I surveyed the other tools I found that most of them only solve part of
the problem, not the whole problem. Those that solve the whole problem are
very hard to use or get started with, or are otherwise very heavyweight. I
wanted a comprehensive framework that was easy to get started with.

Below is a list of the existing tools I have looked at and why I feel they
don't fill the same need as MILC.

| Name | Argument Parsing | Config File | Logging | Subcommands | Subcommand Config |
|------|------------------|-------------|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| MILC | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ |
| [Argparse](#Argparse) | ✔ | ✖ | ✖ | ✔ | ✖ |
| ConfigParser | ✖ | ✔ | ✖ | ✔ | ✖ |

Note: This list was compiled in 2018. In 2020 I edited the list to remove
dead projects but I not go searching for new projects. The time for justifying
MILC's existence has passed.

### Argparse

The built-in argparse module is amazing- MILC uses it under the hood. Using
it directly as an end-user is complicated and error-prone however. The common
patterns mean you end up putting the definition of CLI arguments in a
different place from the code that uses those arguments.

### Cement

<https://builtoncement.com/>

Cement is a very heavy MVC framework for building CLI tools. It includes all
the functionality MILC provides and then some. If you're looking for an
MVC framework for your tool this is the one to pick.

If you are looking for an MVC framework MILC probably isn't what you want.
Use Cement instead.

### Cliar

<https://moigagoo.github.io/cliar/>

This is an interesting library. The author makes some good points about
magic and DSL's. But it requires you to write a class for your CLI. Classes
are good, but not every tool should be a class.

Cliar does not support a configuration file or logging.

### Click

<https://github.com/pallets/click>

You'd have to be a fool or incredibly sure of yourself to compete against one
of Armin Ronacher's projects. :)

Click is great, and I borrowed the decorator concept from Flask before I saw
Click had done the same thing. It terms of how you use it there are a lot of
similarities between Click and MILC.

Where Click and MILC part ways is in the underlying implementation. MILC
uses the recommended and built-in Python modules whenever possible. Under the
hood MILC is just argparse, logging, ConfigParser, and other standard modules
abstracted just enough to make the right thing easy. Click on the other hand
uses optparser, which has been deprecated in favor of argparser, and handles
a lot of functionality itself rather than dispatching to included Python
modules.

MILC does not insist upon a UTF-8 environment for Python 3 the way Click
does. I understand Click's stance here but I'm hoping that the ecosystem has
developed enough by now to make it no longer necessary. Time will tell if
my opinion changes or not.

Whether you should use Click or MILC depends on the tradeoff you want to
make. Would you rather use the Python modules everyone's already familiar with
or dive into a world of custom code that attempts to make everything cleaner
overall? Do you want one cohesive system or do you want to pull together
disparate plugins and modules to build the functionality you need?

Click does not support a configuration file or logging out of the box, but
there are [plugins](https://github.com/click-contrib) you can get to add this
and other functionality to Click.

### Clize

<https://github.com/epsy/clize>

Clize has a nice approach with lots of mature and advanced functionality.

Clize uses function annotation to work, which may or may not fit with how you
work. It also has a lot of arbitrary restrictions due to annotations, for
example alt functions don't work with argument aliases.

Clize does not support a configuration file or logging.

### Cogs

<https://github.com/prometheusresearch/cogs>

Cogs seems interesting, but has its own dedicated CLI tool named `cogs`. You
don't create scripts directly but instead create Python functions that `cogs`
will call. This is not a paradigm that I want to use.

Cogs does not include config file support.

### defopt

<https://github.com/evanunderscore/defopt>

Defopt is a great tool for turning functions into CLIs. Had I found this
earlier I may not have written MILC at all. But I have written MILC, and
there's some things I'm still not sure about. For example, I don't see a way
to have script handle both subcommand and non-subcommand operation.

Defopt does not support a configuration file or logging.

### docopt

<https://github.com/docopt/docopt>

Docopt has a large following, and some interesting ideas. But if you are
someone who does not like the idea of using comments to define behavior you
will not enjoy working with docopt.

Docopt has poor error handling. You have to do your own argument validation,
and even when Docopt knows the passed arguments are invalid it does not return
a useful error message to the user.

Docopt does not support config files.

### Fire

<https://github.com/google/python-fire>

Fire is an interesting idea- turn any class into a CLI. Unfortunately this
is useful more as a tool for introspection than building a good CLI.

Fire does not support a configuration file or logging.

### Plac

<https://github.com/micheles/plac>

I like his idea about scaling down, and it's part of what drove me. But I
don't want to go without functionality to scale down. MILC's idea of scaling
down is working well for small programs.

Plac does not support a configuration file or logging.
